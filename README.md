# Student Knowledge Sharing Platform

This project is dedicated to the development of a forum-style platform where students from LEI (Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática) and LSIRC (Licenciatura em Sistemas e Redes de Informação e de Computadores) courses can share knowledge and ask questions.

## Technology Stack
The platform uses the MEAN stack, which includes:

- **MongoDB**: a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- **Express.js**: a back-end web application framework for Node.js.
- **Angular**: a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework.
- **Node.js**: a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Development Experience

Although not all requirements were met, I am pleased with the results as this was my first project using these technologies, as well as my first project as a full-stack developer. The platform provided a great learning experience in understanding and utilizing the MEAN stack for full-stack development.

## Future Work

While the platform currently serves its primary purpose, there is potential for further development and additional features. Feel free to fork the project and make contributions.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js and MongoDB installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the MongoDB service.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server (myapp).
5. In another terminal, navigate to the folder containing the Angular application (my-app) and run ng serve to start the Angular development server.
Visit http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
